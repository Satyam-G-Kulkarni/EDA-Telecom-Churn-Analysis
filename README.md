# EDA-Telecom-Churn-Analysis

Telecom churn analysis is a crucial process for identifying customers likely to cancel their service or switch providers, impacting a telecom company's revenue. This project utilizes Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset to understand contributing factors to churn and develop strategies for reduction. The following sections provide an overview of the project, steps involved in exploratory data analysis (EDA), and key insights from the analysis.

Overview

Problem Statement

Identify and understand factors contributing to telecom customer churn and develop strategies for reduction.

Dataset

Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset includes cleaned customer activity data with a label specifying whether a customer has churned.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

1. Data Acquisition
   
Obtain a representative sample of data including customer demographic information, usage patterns, and churn status.

3. Data Cleaning
   
Remove missing or incomplete data and ensure that the data is in a format suitable for analysis.

5. Data Visualization
   
Use plots and charts to visualize data, identify trends, and uncover patterns.

7. Data Summarization
   
Apply statistical techniques to summarize data and understand relationships between different variables.
